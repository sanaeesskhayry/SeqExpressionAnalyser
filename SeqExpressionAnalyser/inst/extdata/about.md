# About `SeqExpressionAnalyzer`

`SeqExpressionAnalyzer`is a Bioconductor package containing a Shiny application for analyzing RNA-Seq data from       quality control to differential expression. This comprehensive tool provides an accessible solution for performing interactive and reproducible analysis of RNA-seq data for researchers with many different profiles (life scientists, clinicians, and experienced bioinformaticians) with optimal time and minimal effort.

`SeqExpressionAnalyzer` is a web-based application that allows users to analyze RNA-Seq data in an interactive and reproducible manner. A call to the `RunAnalyser()` method provides the web application with all of its features by completely using the Shiny reactive programming model to efficiently regenerate the rendered components.  
The user interface layout is based on the shiny dashboard package, with a sidebar structured into different tabs that represent the various steps required to perform a comprehensive differential expression analysis, from data setup to functional analysis, and a main panel with full data processing for each step.
